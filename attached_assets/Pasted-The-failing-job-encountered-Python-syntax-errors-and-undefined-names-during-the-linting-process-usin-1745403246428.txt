The failing job encountered Python syntax errors and undefined names during the linting process using `flake8`. Here are the specific issues:

1. **SyntaxError: invalid syntax** - This typically indicates a missing comma, parentheses, or indentation problem in the code.
2. **F821: undefined name 'Import'** - This suggests that there is a reference to `Import` that is not defined in the code.
3. **F824: `global mqtt_client` is unused** - The `mqtt_client` global variable is declared but never assigned a value.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Fix Syntax Errors**:
   - Search the Python files in the repository for syntax issues like missing commas or incorrectly structured code. 
   - Use the error message to locate the exact file and line number causing the issue.

2. **Address Undefined Names**:
   - Ensure that all variables and imports are properly defined. For instance, replace or remove the undefined `Import`.

3. **Resolve Unused Variables**:
   - If `mqtt_client` is not needed, remove it. Otherwise, ensure it is assigned a value.

### Suggested Code Fixes
Assuming the syntax errors are in one of the files listed in the `pyproject.toml` under `swissairdry`, here is an example fix:

#### Example Fix for SyntaxError
If the error is due to a missing comma in a dictionary, fix it as follows:
```python
# Before
config = {
    "host": "localhost"
    "port": 1883  # Missing comma
}

# After
config = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 1883
}
```

#### Example Fix for Undefined `Import`
Replace `Import` with the correct module or variable:
```python
# Before
Import sys

# After
import sys
```

#### Example Fix for `mqtt_client`
If `mqtt_client` is unused:
```python
# Remove the unused global variable
# Before
global mqtt_client

# After
# Removed if not needed
```

### Next Steps
1. Run `flake8` locally to verify the fixes.
2. Push the corrected code to trigger a new workflow. Ensure no new linting or syntax errors occur.
